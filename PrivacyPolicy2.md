# Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 21, 2022

When you use the free plan, Sharp IOL Calculator app doesn't collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences, if any) created by  you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Howevere for a paid plan the app stores your email address in Google Firebase server so it can identify the users who purchased it and deliver the required services accordingly.
Your email address is not used for any other purposes nor it is shared with any other third-party services.

If you have purchased any paid plan inside the app you can request to delete your email address by sending an email to our contact email which is listed below, however you should know that by deleting your email address you will lose permanently any paid plan you have purchased without any refund, so if you needed to request an email address removal we highly recommend to take this step after your paid plan period is ended.
